This homework assignment went fairly well.

I did not have time to complete the entire Bonus section.

- Reflect Tables into SQLAlchemy ORM
	- I was able to do these steps.

- Exploratory Climate Analysis
	- The activities were very helpful to find the code to use as an example for these sections.

- Step 2 Climate App
	Day 3 activity 10 was the most helpful here, but my tutor helped me with the last <start>/<end> route

- Bonus
	I was able to do the trip avg temp bar chart, and then ran out of time.
